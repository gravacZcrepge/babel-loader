The Revised Penal Code (RPC) is the main source of criminal law in the Philippines. It was enacted in 1930 and has undergone several amendments since then. The RPC consists of two books: Book 1, which covers the general principles of criminal law and the definition and penalties of crimes; and Book 2, which deals with specific crimes and their penalties.
 
Book 1 of the RPC is authored by Luis B. Reyes, a renowned Filipino jurist and legal scholar. He has written several books on criminal law, civil law, constitutional law, and legal ethics. He was also a former dean of the College of Law of the University of the Philippines and a former justice of the Court of Appeals.
