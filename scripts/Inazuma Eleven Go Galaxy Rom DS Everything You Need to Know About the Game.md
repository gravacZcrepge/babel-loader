## Step 2: Download the Translation Patches
 
The game files you downloaded are already patched with English translations, but if you want to play the game in French, you will need to download additional files that contain the French translations. These files are called MODs and they work with the Citra emulator. You can find them on YouTube, where a user named JeuxMangas has uploaded a video tutorial on how to play the game in French. Here is the link for the video:

## Step 3: Download and Install Citra Emulator
 
Citra is an open-source emulator that allows you to play Nintendo 3DS games on your PC. You can download it from its official website: [https://citra-emu.org/download/](https://citra-emu.org/download/). Choose the version that suits your operating system and follow the instructions to install it.
 
## Step 4: Load the Game Files and Translation Patches on Citra
 
Once you have installed Citra, launch it and click on File > Install CIA... Browse to the folder where you extracted the game file in .cia format and select it. Wait for Citra to install it. Repeat this process for both versions of the game if you want to play both.
 
Next, click on File > Select Game Directory... Browse to the folder where you extracted the game file in .cia format and select it. This will add the game to your Citra library.
 
To load the translation patches, click on Emulation > Configure... Go to Graphics > Enhancements and check Enable Custom Textures. Then go to System > Miscellaneous and check Enable Mods. Click OK to save your settings.
 
Next, go to C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Roaming\Citra\load\mods\0004000000139800 (for Big Bang) or C:\Users\
