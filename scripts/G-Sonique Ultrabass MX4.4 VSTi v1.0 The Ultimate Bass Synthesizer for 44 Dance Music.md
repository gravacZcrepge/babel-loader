1. Oscillator 1: This is the main oscillator that generates the sound. You can choose from 15 shapes, such as analogue saw, digital saw, pulse, multisaw, vintage saw and more. You can also adjust the octave, semitone and fine tuning of the oscillator, as well as the phase micro-control knob that lets you change the phase of the waveform.
2. Oscillator 2: This is the second oscillator that can work in two modes: single or dual. In single mode, it acts as a sub-oscillator that adds more low-end to the sound. In dual mode, it acts as a second oscillator that can be detuned from the first one for a richer sound. You can also choose from 15 shapes, adjust the octave, semitone and fine tuning, and change the phase of the waveform.
3. Oscillator mode: This lets you choose how the two oscillators work together. You can choose from normal (both oscillators are mixed), ring mod (the output of one oscillator modulates the amplitude of the other), sync (the second oscillator resets its phase according to the first one), FM (the output of one oscillator modulates the frequency of the other) or AM (the output of one oscillator modulates both the frequency and amplitude of the other).
4. Oscillator spread: This lets you widen or narrow the stereo image of the sound by changing the phase difference between the left and right channels.
5. Filter module 1: This is the first filter module that lets you apply one of four types of low-pass filters to your sound: G-low pass (a smooth and liquid filter), low pass (a classic filter), vintage analog low pass (a warm and creamy filter) or 303 low pass (a resonant and acid filter). You can adjust the cutoff frequency, resonance, input volume and envelope amount of the filter.
6. Filter module 2: This is the second filter module that lets you apply one of nine types of filters to your sound: G-low pass, G-band pass, G-high pass (three filters modeled after hardware DSP chips), low pass, high pass, band pass, band reject, pe 8cf37b1e13
